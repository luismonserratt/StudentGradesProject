## 📖 Description
This is a simple **Java console application** that helps manage student grades.  
The program allows the user to enter grades for a number of students (1–50).  
It validates inputs, stores them in an array, and then calculates:

- ✅ Highest grade  
- ✅ Lowest grade  
- ✅ Average grade  

All results are displayed in a clear format on the console.
